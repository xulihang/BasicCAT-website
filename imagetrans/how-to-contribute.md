You can contribute to the development of ImageTrans in the following aspects:

1. Document Translation

   ImageTrans's documentation is created using Sphinx and hosted on readthedocs.

   The repository: <https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans-docs>

   You need to use Sphinx's localization tool to extract the text to po files and translate them.

2. Translation of UI

   ImageTrans uses [B4XLocalizator](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-localizator-localize-your-b4x-applications.68751/) to localize its UI. The strings.xlsx file needs to be translated. After translation, it can be converted to strings.db for ImageTrans to use.

   You can get the strings.xlsx here:<https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans_l10n_en/releases/tag/strings>

3. Plug-ins Development

   ImageTrans uses ABPlugin to create plugins. Source code of existing plug-ins:<https://github.com/xulihang/ImageTrans_plugins>
