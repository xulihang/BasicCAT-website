## Intro

ImageTrans is a computer-aided image transcription and translation tool. It can automatically locate text areas and perform OCR operations using state-of-art OCR technology and a homebrew text areas merging and detecting algorithm, which is specially designed for comics(including manga and manhua). The original text can be automatically erased and the translation be reinjected.

ImageTrans has a high interoperability that it can export text to Word and Excel files and use scripts to interact with image editors like Photoshop.

ImageTrans is also a computer-aided translation (CAT) tool, which supports corpus concordance, translation memory, terminology management and machine translation. It has a sound effects words search engine designed for comics.

ImageTrans is cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux) as BasicCAT does.
