ImageTrans integrates a Hot Folder feature in v5.6.0 that monitors whether a folder has new files added, and if so, it processes those files by executing the specified workflow using the current project as a template.

Here's the basic operation steps:

1. Create a new project and set up things like language, OCR, custom workflows, and more.
2. If you want to support importing and exporting PDFs, you need to define the settings for importing and exporting in advance in the project settings, and add the exporting PDF in the workflow.
3. Through the menu bar - Tools - Hot Folder, open Hot Folder, set the folder to be monitored, and then you can batch OCR and translation files.
