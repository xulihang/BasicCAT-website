Regular expression is a pattern for matching text. In BasicCAT and ImageTrans, we can use it to find and replace text.

We can learn about regular expressions in [this website](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).

Here is a list of useful regular expressions:

* `.*?` match all text
* `[0-9]` match all numbers
* `[a-zA-Z]` match all English characters
* `[\u4e00-\u9fa5]` match all Chinese characters


The list is to be enriched...
