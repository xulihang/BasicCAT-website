Changelog:

* Support right to left languages like Arabic, Hebrew and Persian ([related issue](https://github.com/xulihang/BasicCAT/issues/24)). Since only the default TextArea of JavaFX supports right to left languages, RichTextArea is not enabled when translating with RTL languages.
* An option to use TextArea instead of RichTextArea
