This new version has many improvements, so I jump the version num to 1.5.

Changelog:

* Use Okapi Tikal to handle other file formats, which will automatically convert original files to XLIFF files and generate target files from translated XLIFF files.
* Better XLIFF support. seg-segment and group elements are supported.
* Change the segment action "mark as non-translatable" to "mark as neglected" as the latter is more suitable for this action.
* New MT plugins: Amazon and IBM Watson
* Other bug fixes
