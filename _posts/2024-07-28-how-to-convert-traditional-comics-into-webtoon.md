Traditional comics (manga) are usually drawn in a format suitable for printing on A5 or A4 paper. With the popularity of e-reading devices such as mobile phones, webtoon has comes up. It arranges comic panels on a long image in a size suitable for mobile phone reading. Readers can just keep reading by swiping down.

Converting an existing traditional comics to webtoon usually involves rearranging subplots and redrawing speech bubbles. You can refer to [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN8brEkMRv4) by comic artist Jason Brubaker.
