For windows system before win8, the input method works fine in BasicCAT. But for win8/win10, the input method has a problem that the candidate window shows at the right bottom of the screen. This is a java's problem. To solve this problem, we have to install proper input method.

For Chinese inputing, [sogou intelligent version](https://pinyin.sogou.com/zhihui/) is recommended. For Japanese inputing, the default ime works fine.

The input method works fine in macOS.
