Here are a list of translation tools I developed:


1. XLSX to TMX

	This tool will read the first sheet of xlsx files. The table should have heads which are language codes like zh-CN, en-US.

	Example:

	```

	zh-CN	en-US
	你好	Hello
	```
	
	[Download](https://github.com/xulihang/Translation-Tools/releases/download/v1.0/XLSXToTMX.jar)
	
2. Aligner

	This tool aligns source text and target text from individual files or one single bilingual file.

	Detailed intro: [New Tool! Bitext Aligner](/new-tool-bitext-aligner/)
	
	
PS: You need Java Runtime Environment 8 to run these tools.
