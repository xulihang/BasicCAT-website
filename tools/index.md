Here are a list of translation tools I developed:


1. XLSX to TMX

	This tool will read the first sheet of xlsx files. The table should have heads which are language codes like zh-CN, en-US.

	Example:

	```

	zh-CN	en-US
	你好	Hello
	```
	
	[Download](https://github.com/xulihang/Translation-Tools/releases/download/v1.0/XLSXToTMX.jar)
	
2. Aligner

	This tool aligns source text and target text from individual files or one single bilingual file.

3. PSD Localization

	This tool extracts text from psd files and refills translation. Need Photoshop installed. Currently, only windows is supported.

4. Image Transcriber

	This tool aids people to OCR images. It can furthur generate PSD files with text layers.
